In general: The project fits nicely!

Some feedback from our side:
- no references (-1p)
- unclear what model architecture will be used. (-1p)
- evaluation of the system unclear, what metrics will you use? How will you measure the performance of your entire system? (-1.5p)
-> for example qualitative analysis (human evaluation): are the results based on a query correct?

Nice project idea! Looking forward to its development.
